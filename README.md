# Heimdall

This project is still in development. Please install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to run it.

# How to use the app

You need to run a CheckNanterre server under Vagrant (using our [dev vagrant](https://github.com/ChaudhryHaseeb/Check-Nanterre) for now).

To test the application, don't forget to change IP address in lib > reset_password.dart (line 32) by your IP address. You write your ip address to access the core of the app with your IDs but reset password is out of its perimeter.
